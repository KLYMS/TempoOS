1. Memory Management
Learn: How Protected Mode enables access to more memory and better memory protection.
Implement:
GDT (Global Descriptor Table): You likely set up a basic GDT for Protected Mode, but now you can extend it for different segments (code, data, etc.).
Paging: Set up paging to manage memory efficiently and enable virtual memory. Start by creating simple page tables for a basic memory mapping and understand how to configure control registers (CR0, CR3).
Heap Management: Implement a simple heap manager for dynamic memory allocation in the kernel (e.g., using malloc and free).

2. Interrupt Handling and Exception Management
Learn: About interrupt vectors, ISR (Interrupt Service Routines), and PIC (Programmable Interrupt Controller).
Implement:
IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table): Define entries in the IDT for handling various interrupts and CPU exceptions.
Interrupt Handlers: Set up basic interrupt handlers for CPU exceptions (e.g., divide by zero) and device interrupts (like keyboard and timer).
PIC Remapping: Remap the PIC to avoid conflicts with CPU exceptions, allowing better control over hardware interrupts.

3. System Calls
Learn: How to provide a mechanism for user-space programs to request services from the kernel in a safe way.
Implement:
System Call Interface: Set up a basic system call mechanism using software interrupts (like interrupt 0x80).
Syscall Handlers: Implement basic system calls (e.g., for input/output or simple string manipulation) and create syscall handlers to process them.
User and Kernel Separation: Ensure safe transitions between user-space and kernel-space by managing privileges in segment descriptors.

4. User-Space Program Execution
Learn: The basics of process management and how to load and execute user programs.
Implement:
ELF Loader: Write a simple ELF loader to load executable files in the ELF format into memory.
Program Execution: Implement a function to jump to the entry point of loaded programs.
Multitasking (Optional): If ready, implement basic cooperative or preemptive multitasking by saving and switching CPU contexts.

5. Drivers for Essential Devices
Learn: How the kernel communicates with hardware.
Implement:
Keyboard Driver: Write a keyboard driver to handle key presses, which allows basic user interaction.
Screen (Text Mode) Driver: Extend your current video memory code to support scrolling, colors, and formatting text output.
Timer (PIT) Driver: Program the PIT (Programmable Interval Timer) to create a time base, enabling features like preemptive multitasking or simple delays.

6. File System Basics
Learn: The structure of a basic file system and how files are stored and accessed.
Implement:
RAM Disk: Set up a basic in-memory file system to load and store files for testing purposes.
Simple File System: Implement a basic filesystem (like FAT12 or a custom format) to handle files, directories, and basic file operations (open, read, write).
VFS (Virtual File System) Abstraction (Optional): Abstract the filesystem interface to support multiple types of file systems later.

7. Library (libc) Development for User-Space Programs
Learn: About standard C library functions and how theyâ€™re implemented at a low level.
Implement:
Basic libc Functions: Implement essential C standard library functions like printf, malloc, memcpy, strcmp, etc.
System Call Wrappers: Create wrappers for system calls, allowing user programs to use familiar C function interfaces.

8. User-Space Applications
Learn: Basic concepts of application design and inter-process communication (IPC).
Implement:
Shell Program: Write a simple shell to accept user commands and execute programs.
Basic IPC: Implement basic IPC mechanisms (e.g., pipes or message passing).
Text Editor or Calculator: Build simple applications to demonstrate interaction with the OS and use of system calls.
